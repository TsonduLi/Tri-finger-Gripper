# Industrial Robot Gripper Development

## Overview
During my tenure as an Undergraduate Researcher at the Autonomous Robotics Laboratory, Haifa, Israel, I spearheaded the development of two novel industrial robot grippers: a parallel gripper and a tri-finger gripper, leading the project from August 2021 to June 2023.

## Development Cycle
The development process spanned mechanical design through multiple iterations to enhance the prototypes, culminating in the final software development phase and integration.

## Software Interface and Integration
Key contributions included:
- Crafting the ROS-based software interface for the grippers, ensuring seamless robotic arm interaction.
- Advanced C++ and Arduino programming for robust motion control.
- Implementing adaptive trajectory planning algorithms for noise-resilient control.

## Testing and Validation
- Conducted extensive simulations in ROS Gazebo.
- Performed physical testing on robotic arms, affirming the grippers' versatility and reliability in varied handling scenarios.

## Recognition
The project's success led to the grippers' adoption in advanced laboratory applications and recognition for research excellence.
